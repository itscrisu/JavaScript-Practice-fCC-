# JavaScript Practice (from freeCodeCamp)

## • index.js - It's called: "Counting Cards". 
They basically asks us to make a function that could receive a _card_ parameter, wich can be a string or a number, and increment or decrement the global _count_ 
variable according to the card's value. The function will then return a string with the current count and the string _Bet_ if the count is positive, or _Hold_ 
if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

## • objectsForLookups.js - It's called: Using Objects for Lookups
I had to convert a 'switch' statement into an 'object' called _lookup_. Then, I had to use it to look up _val_ and assign the associated string to the _result_ variable.
